                            <p>Named by Rolling Stone as one of the Top 10 Acts to Watch This Year, LOOKAS is an undoubtable force to be reckoned with.<br><br> 

							His recent explosive track “Can’t Get Enough” can still be heard in every trap set nearly a year after release, and his follow-up is a soon-to-be-released single coming out on Island Records featuring Cat from Timeflies. LOOKAS also has an EP coming out on Monstercat later this year featuring Krewella. No stranger to working together, he is also the producer on the duo’s current soaring single “Be There.”<br><br>

							In addition to his international tour stops throughout 2017, LOOKAS will be making waves at some of the hottest festivals including LA’s HARD Summer music festival and Montreal’s Il Soniq.  <br><br>

							The self-taught Miami upstart first arrived on the scene in late 2013 making major headwaves with his groundbreaking remix of "Tsunami" by DVBBS and Borgeous which was commissioned by Ministry of Sound and released as an official mix in early 2014. With over three million soundcloud plays, the success of the track gained LOOKAS international exposure and major recognition within the dance community. Next followed the noteworthy remix of "War" by Low Rider and the multi platinum-selling single by which he was approached by Flo Rida & Sage the Gemini for "GDFR".<br><br>
							 
							Billboard.com's "Next Big Sound" was quick to recognize LOOKAS as one of the top 10 artists on their Rising Artist Chart. Noted for his signature festival trap sound, LOOKAS has performed at top music festivals including Electric Daisy Carnival Las Vegas, Ultra Music Festival, Tomorrowworld, Beyond Wonderland SoCal, Safe in Sound, and Bassrush.</p>

                        <p>Philadelphia based artist Able Heart is a singer, songwriter, producer, and engineer whose uniquely all-encompassing approach to creating emotionally-rich contemporary pop-soul offers a refreshing breath of authenticity, in a climate that increasingly demands it. Initially aspiring to be a professional snowboarder with four years of competition and worldwide traveling, he suffered a devastating injury that forced him to hang up his gloves & caused his career path to veer in an alternate direction. Losing what he loved most in this world, Able struggled with drugs and addiction at a very young age. He has aspired to new heights and is determined to overcome his struggles. The result: a finely polished debut body of work eight years in the making--a solo release in every sense of the term--that is both deeply personal and immediately relatable.</p>

                        <p> A vanguard in his own right, Rob Garza has consistently pushed conceptual frontiers, succeeding in an intercontinental legion of musical prowess and accomplishing a covetable sonic narrative. <br><br>

						The San Francisco-based producer and co-founder of Thievery Corporation, known for their holistic performances and electronic-infused modifications of dub, trip hop, reggae, and bossa nova, has maintained a prolific career owing to his ever-evolving taste and diverse influences based off the cultures and styles encountered during his travels. Constantly inspired by his surroundings and experiences, Garza’s artistic foresight has always supported a fundamental motif of connecting people through music. As a solo artist, Rob Garza infuses his own adept house and nu-disco artistry into every one of his productions, boasting a specific style that is perceptive, powerful and globally-stimulated. <br><br>

						Elementally defined by his unique perspective, Rob Garza’s work is a glowing attraction to the relationship between human emotion and musical expression, while his sonorous and multi-faceted output continually strengthens the backbone of his experiential pedigree - a distinctive merit that remains uniquely unmatched. </p>
